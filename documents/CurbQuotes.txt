Pretty-ay,
prett-ay,
prett-ay good.

Congratulations on
a great attempt
at a chat and cut...

A date is an experience
you have with another person
that makes you appreciate being alone.

Do you respect wood?

Milk and coffee!
Who'd have thought?

So he asked me:
'You pee sitting down?
Do you crap standing up?"

It seems silly to me to put a napkin
on an old pair of pants.

I'm trying to elevate
small talk to medium talk

I don't like talking to people I know,
but strangers
 I have no problem with.

I'm not a person who embraces challenges.
I run away from challenges.
I break world records running from challenges.

What is this compulsion
to have people over at your house
and serve them food and talk to them?

Women love a self-confident bald man.

I would like to tell my wife I look like Brad Pitt,
but unfortunately,
she can see.

Can I tell you something about apricots?...
1 in 30 is a good one.
It is such a low percentage fruit.

I just can't stand
the sound of the human voice.

I'm Larry David.
I happen to enjoy wearing women's panties.

I'm a walking,
talking enigma.
We're a dying breed.

I go out to dinner,
I wind up
with a homework assignment.

A good compromise
is when both parties
are dissatisfied.
